## Details

These background artworks were gathered from a wide range of sources. Some of the background art is sourced from digital media, while others are reinstated from poor copies of the original source material. It is important to note that the images available in this collection are not considered "restorations". While the images have undergone color correction and general clean up, the images have then been saturated to "dull" the colors thus allowing the character(s) on the animation cel to be the true hero of your artwork.

All the images have a resolution of 300 DPI, which is considered high-resolution.
